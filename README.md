## **Matching Algorithm** 🔍  
The **matching system** assigns a compatibility score based on:  
✔️ **Languages Spoken** (higher weight)  
✔️ **Shared Interests**  
✔️ **Nationality**  
✔️ **Faculty**  
✔️ **Gender Preferences**  

The system ensures **optimal pairings** while maintaining fairness and balancing the number of available ESNers and Buddies.

## **Security Considerations** 🔒  
🔹 **Password Hashing:** Secure storage with `werkzeug.security.generate_password_hash()`  
🔹 **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Only authorized users can access admin routes  
🔹 **Session Management:** Prevents unauthorized access  
🔹 **Input Validation:** Sanitization of user input to prevent SQL injection & XSS
