Email Service Module

This module defines the `EmailService` class, which provides methods for sending various types
of email notifications within the ESN matchmaking system. It utilizes the Flask-Mail extension
to handle email sending operations, allowing the application to communicate with users via email.

Components:

- EmailService Class: Manages the setup and sending of emails using Flask-Mail.
  - Methods:
    - `send_email(to_email, subject, template)`: Sends a generic email with the specified recipient, subject, and HTML template.
    - `send_match_notification_buddy(buddy, esner)`: Sends a notification email to a Buddy when they are matched with an ESNer.
    - `send_match_notification_esner(buddy, esner)`: Sends a notification email to an ESNer when a Buddy is assigned to them.
    - `send_unmatch_notification_buddy(buddy)`: Sends a notification email to a Buddy when their match is removed.
    - `send_unmatch_notification_esner(buddy, esner)`: Sends a notification email to an ESNer when a Buddy is removed from their match list.
    - `send_data_elimination_notification(name, email)`: Sends a notification email to a user when their data is removed from the system.
    - `send_reset_password_email(email, password)`: Sends a password reset email to the specified email address with a new password.
    - `send_registration_confirmation(buddy)`: Sends a confirmation email to a Buddy upon successful registration.

Usage:

- Create an instance of `EmailService` to use its methods for sending emails.
- Ensure that the Flask application is configured with the necessary email server settings.

Example:

```python
from flask import Flask
from email_service import email_service

app = Flask(__name__)
# Configure your app with email server settings
email_service.send_match_notification_buddy(buddy, esner)
```
Security Note: Ensure that sensitive information such as email credentials is kept secure and not exposed in version control systems.
